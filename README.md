# CheeseMVC
Get some hands-on practice with views in MVC. Work on these exercises within the CheeseMVC app that was created during part 1 and part 2 of our Intro to MVC Views lessons.

Add a description field to the application. This will involve:
Modifying the static cheeses list to be a dictionary with key/value pairs that correspond to the name and description.
Adding a new form field in Cheese/Add.cshtml to allow for submission of the description.
Modify the NewCheese action to insert the description of the new cheese into the cheeses dictionary.
Display the description field in the Cheese/Index.cshtml view template.
Use _Layout.cshtml. In other words, remove Layout = null from the top of the templates, and modify _Layout.cshtml to reflect links for the CheeseMVC app (only Home and Add for now).
